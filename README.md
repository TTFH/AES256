# AES256
Encrypt/Decrypt files using AES256 ECB ANSI X9.23

# [DEPRECATED] DO NOT USE. This repo is just for learning purposes only.

EXAMPLE:
```
C:\Users\User\aes256>g++ -Wall -Werror -O3 AES256.cpp -o aes256

C:\Users\User\aes256>aes256
This program encrypts/decrypts files
using AES256 encryption with ECB mode of operation
and ANSI X9.23 padding method

The maximum supported file size is 4GB
Enough RAM is required to load the file
Encrypted files are 1 to 16 bytes larger than the original ones

Choose an option:
        1) Generate random key (DON'T USE, THIS RNG CAN BE EASILY REVERTED)
        2) Load key from file
        3) Type key
